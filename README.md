# rw-metal

A close to the metal implementation of my mini-site. What's the minimum I need to pleasantly write and deploy a couple files to the internet?

## Setup

```bash
# Use the specified node version
nvm use

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Develop locally
npm ???

# Build for production
npm ???

# Deploy
npm ???
```
